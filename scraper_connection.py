    Function to query the MongoDB instance and obtain results for the desired

                Collection within MongoDB that holds the scraped news stories.

    lt_date: Datetime object.
                    Date for which results should be older than. For example,
                    if the date running is the 25th, and the desired date is
                    the 24th, then the `lt_date` is the 25th.

    sources: List.
                Sources to pull from the MongoDB instance.

    write_file: Boolean.
                Option indicating whether to write the results from the web
